# Decisions

Deviation log: where the specification was ambiguous or the environment
forced a choice, the decision and its reasoning are recorded here, most
recent last.

## D1. Plugin lives in `emailexpert-events/`, not the repo root

The spec says "repo root is the plugin", but the target repository
(`id12y/emailexpert-news-scout`) already contains an unrelated Python
project. Deleting or displacing it would be destructive, so the plugin is
self-contained in `emailexpert-events/` and that directory follows all the
repo-root conventions (bootstrap file, `src/`, `docs/`, …). The CI workflow
lives at the repo-level `.github/workflows/plugin-ci.yml` with
`working-directory: emailexpert-events`. To deploy, copy or symlink the
`emailexpert-events/` directory into `wp-content/plugins/`.

## D2. Unit tests run on a lightweight WordPress stub layer

The spec asks for PHPUnit via wp-env. wp-env needs Docker-in-Docker plus
network image pulls that are not reliable in this build environment, so the
suite is written as pure unit tests against `tests/wp-stubs.php` (an
in-memory implementation of the narrow WordPress surface the plugin uses,
every stub `function_exists`-guarded so real WordPress wins when present).
This keeps the suite fast, deterministic and runnable in CI without Docker.
`.wp-env.json` is still shipped and working for local integration testing.

## D3. Blocks ship as plain-JS dynamic blocks, no build step

All blocks are dynamic (server-rendered) and their editor scripts are
plain JavaScript using the `wp.*` globals (`registerBlockType` +
`ServerSideRender`), so the repository needs no Node build to produce a
working plugin. `@wordpress/scripts` remains the documented path if JSX is
ever wanted. This satisfies "no block stores data in post content" and keeps
the shipped artefact dependency-free.

## D4. Talk→event filter parameter is negotiated at runtime

The correct query parameter for "talks belonging to event X" is unknown
(docs unreadable). `SyncEngine` tries `?event=<id>`; if results include
talks whose own `event` field points elsewhere, it falls back to
`?event_id=<id>`, and finally to client-side filtering of the full
collection. The discovery diagnostic records what the talks resource really
looks like so the operator can confirm.

## D5. Speaker photo field name is a candidate list

`avatar` (string or `{url: …}`) then `photo_url` then `photo` then
`avatar_url`. First match wins; recorded in `_eex_photo_source_url` so a
changed URL triggers a re-download.

## D6. Sync writes descriptions to meta, never post_content

Spec 4.4 offers this as the "simplest compliant approach" and it is taken:
synced descriptions land in `_eex_description`, templates render from meta,
and `post_content` belongs entirely to editors. The
`<!-- eex:synced-content -->` marker is therefore unnecessary, but sync also
never touches post_content, so any editor content is safe by construction.

## D7. Webhook dedupe bucket is 15 minutes

Spec 8.1: dedupe on a hash of (action, attendee identifier, timestamp
bucket). HeySummit retries failed deliveries every 15 minutes up to 3
times, so the bucket is 15 minutes and the dedupe transient lives 2 hours —
long enough to cover the full retry window, short enough that a genuine
re-registration days later still counts.

## D8. "Evergreen" detection

An event is treated as evergreen when `is_evergreen` is truthy, or when the
API omits both `first_talk_at` and `last_talk_at`. Evergreen events never
appear in past-events lists and count as upcoming while
`is_open_for_registrations` is true.

## D9. Attribution `amount_gross` stored as string

Ticket price shape is unverified (currency, cents vs decimal). The column
is a varchar holding whatever the attendee record exposes, avoiding a wrong
numeric normalisation; the report sums only when values parse as numeric.

## D10. Elementor widgets registered from one definition table

Rather than 10 hand-written widget classes, a single `Widget` base class is
parameterised by the same component definition table that drives blocks and
shortcodes (`Frontend\Components::definitions()`). Guarantees the
"identical output" acceptance criterion by construction and keeps the
module a thin control-mapping layer, per spec 7.7.

## D11. PHPCS ruleset exclusions

WordPress-Extra with three exclusions: short array syntax allowed, PSR-4
file naming (src/ClassName.php) instead of class-*.php, and short ternaries
allowed. All are style-only; security sniffs all active.

## D12. `wp-env` phpVersion pinned to 8.1

Matches the minimum supported PHP so local integration testing catches
8.1-incompatible syntax; CI runs the unit suite on 8.1 and 8.3.

## D13. Replay URL: two keys, manual wins

Spec 4.3 names one key `_eex_replay_url` sourced from the API but editor-
owned with manual precedence. Two writes into one key cannot express "manual
always wins", so the synced value lands in `_eex_replay_url_synced` and the
meta box writes `_eex_replay_url`; every render path (cards, singles,
VideoObject schema, dynamic tags) resolves manual ?: synced.

## D14. BusinessEvent when a venue exists

Spec 7.3 says "use BusinessEvent for FORUM-style conferences" without
defining FORUM-style machine-readably. Chosen signal: an event with manual
venue meta filled in (an in-person conference) emits `BusinessEvent`;
venue-less (online/evergreen hub) events emit `Event`. Deterministic,
editor-controllable, and matches the examples given.

## D15. Webhook verification failure: attribution logged, counter not

Spec 8.1 requires state-mutating actions to verify by re-fetching the
attendee and to use fetched data. When verification fails (API unreachable
or no key configured), the registration counter — public-facing state — is
NOT incremented, and a warning is logged. The attribution row IS still
inserted from the payload (email already hashed): attribution is an internal
report where a flagged-in-log unverified row is more useful than a silently
dropped signal. A later verified retry of the same delivery is deduplicated,
so no double rows.

## D16. Webhook processing queue

Receipt returns 200 immediately and processing runs via
wp_schedule_single_event + spawn_cron (a queued single event per spec 8.2).
Dedupe happens at receipt time so HeySummit's 15-minute retries do not queue
duplicate jobs even if processing is slow.

# v2 extension run

## D17. Lazy initialisation model

Activation now does only: CPT/taxonomy registration, term seeding, rewrite
flush, the single autoloaded `eex_settings` option, and a dismissible
wizard-offer option. The log table is created on first log write and the
attribution table when webhooks are enabled (belt-and-braces guard at
insert), both guarded by a stored schema version (`eex_schema_versions`)
plus a per-request static — creation is never attempted per request. The
sync cron exists only while at least one event is enabled; the daily
maintenance cron is scheduled with the first table. The webhook secret is
generated the first time the Webhooks settings section renders rather than
at activation. `eex_settings` is the one autoloaded option; everything
bulky (discovery snapshots, availability caches, schema versions) stays
non-autoloaded. Term seeding moved from per-request init to activation.
Upgrades from v1 are safe: dbDelta reconciles existing tables on the first
guarded write and the schema option starts tracking from there.

## D18. Untimed talks count as upcoming in the time scope

The time scope splits on `starts_at` versus now. Talks the API returns with
no start time cannot be "past", so they ride with the future bucket:
"future: none" drops them, past modes never touch them. Consistent with the
front end, where untimed talks appear in neither upcoming nor past lists.

## D19. Wizard step 2 session counts via DRF pagination

Per-event session counts come from `talks/?event=<id>&page_size=1`, reading
the DRF `count` field — one cheap GET per event at wizard time instead of
paging whole collections. When the field is absent the count is simply
omitted from the listing (never guessed).

## D20. Wizard state is the standard settings

Step 1 writes the connection, step 2 enables/disables events in
`eex_synced_events`, steps 3–4 merge scope into the same rows, and
confirmation kicks the ordinary async sync and cron scheduling. Abandoning
the wizard mid-way leaves a valid partial configuration and no orphaned
state; the only wizard-specific options are the dismissible notice flag and
a started-at timestamp used by the progress poll.
